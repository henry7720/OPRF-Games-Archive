    <h1>Change Log</h1>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>10/4/19</strong> - Updated Tetris (same game, but the useless "high scores" tab is removed, and it will no longer ask for "your name"). Now it is easier and more efficient to play!</li>
      <li><strong>5/20/19</strong> - If you didn't know already, the support forms officially work again! We will be doing our best to keep up with the requests. Created a downloadable version of the site embedder, available on the Site Embedder page.</li>
      <li><strong>5/17/19</strong> - Created a new perma-link that will always redirect to the games page of this website: <a href="http://currentlcdomain.cf/" title="currentlcdomain.cf">CURRENTLCDOMAIN.CF</a>, even when the domain is changed. Fixed constantly-refreshing bug on the proxy. Cleared old change log entries, reformatted so that newest entries go to the top (about time!) [Temporarily?] Removed Slope from the navbar, we will be fixing it soon. Feel free to request games/report broken games at the support forms!</li>
      <li><strong>5/16/19</strong> - It has been a very long time since this site has been put to use, or it has been updated, but -- it is officially back. Added Classic Minecraft, updated Site Embedder (originally: Site Unblocker) so that it will show the loaded URL in the URL box when you click from a bookmarked link. Reordered games/unblockers in the navbar, fixed the support forms. [Temporarily?] Removed the FAQs page from the navbar, since it is essentially useless and, if it is to remain, needs to be updated. [Temporarily?] Removed 2KMTCentral from the navbar. Also changed the font to Roboto. More updates to come in the future.</li>
      <li><strong>9/18/18</strong> - Nice to know you guys have been enjoying the website! The Site Unblocker has been updated so that there are now permanent links: enter a URL as you would before and copy the link from the input that appears.</li>
      <li><strong>9/14/18</strong> - [LATE UPDATE CHANGE]: sorry for not updating the site as often as we would hope. Here are the newly added games: Starjack, Bruh and Moomoo. We will add more within the coming days.</li>
      <li><strong>8/29/18</strong> - Reordered games in the navbar, removed redundant fullscreen button from Surviv, added Advanced Pixel Apocalypse 3 back.</li>
      <li><strong>8/28/18</strong> - Fixed Slope (updated)... made small updates to the homepage and grammar.</li>
      <li><strong>8/27/18</strong> - [LATE UPDATE CHANGE] We have changed our site back to its' old Linear Equations theme; and back to www.linearequations.cf.</li>
      <li><strong>8/19/18</strong> - Updated the in-tab browser icon to something much simpler and easier to see.</li>
      <li><strong>8/16/18</strong> - Revamped the site for OPRF, updated logo in most places. We've also switched domains (from www.gbmsgames.cf to www.oprfgames.tk). Time for a brand new year!</li>
      <!-- Old entries:
      <li><strong>2/9/18</strong> - The first draft of the new <a href="<?php echo "http" . (($_SERVER["HTTPS"] == "on") ? "s" : "") . "://" . $_SERVER["HTTP_HOST"] . "/"; ?>">OPRF Games</a> site has been released. Coded from scratch, we [the developers] hope you guys will enjoy it. Many of people's favorite games were also added to the new site, with more coming soon.</li>
      <li><strong>2/10/18</strong> - Optimized webpages for search engines. Made small improvements in code. Began FAQs page.</li>
      <li><strong>2/11/18</strong> - Began the Site Unblocker, almost finished FAQs page.</li>
      <li><strong>2/12/18</strong> - First complete testing day, every page on the old site has a new link to this site. ALL pages are in a testing phase, so if you find any bugs, glitches and/or errors and you need help, please contact us on one of the forms, or join our <a href="https://discord.gg/RV875qX">Discord</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>2/13/18</strong> - The site unblocker is still underway, progress is being made behind the scenes. Shell Shockers has unfortunately been blocked.</li>
      <li><strong>2/24/18</strong> - We're finally back at our <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/linearequations2018/">Google Site</a>. Also, now you can use a keyboard shortcut (CTRL+B/CMND+B) to go back to the <a href="/">hidden homepage</a> on any game/site page. [[once an html comment: So when a teacher comes by, quickly tap CTRL+B/CMND+B, and you should be in the clear.]]</li>
      <li><strong>3/1/18</strong> - We have finally updated our Site Unblocker so it accepts URLs without http/https before it, plus you also no longer have to click Submit, you can just hit enter. We are also nearly finished with a fullscreen feature for all games without it built in, plus we finally added some sort of color scheme to the site.</li>
      <li><strong>3/7/18</strong> - Sorry for the many-day hiatus, but, our webhost has been ON THE FRITZ! We have tried for at least 7 days to get the site back up, but have been unable.</li>
      <li><strong>3/12/18</strong> - We are still trying to get means to put the site up, plus we have made improvements to our styles...</li>
      <li><strong>3/16/18</strong> - We are finally back up on <a href="<?php echo "http" . (($_SERVER["HTTPS"] == "on") ? "s" : "") . "://" . $_SERVER["HTTP_HOST"] . "/"; ?>">Linear Equations</a>. We had major webhosting issues and am saddened to say so. Here's to awhile without getting blocked.</li>
      <li><strong>3/23/18</strong> - The <a href="https://discord.gg/RV875qX">Discord</a> link has been updated on the homepage.</li>
      <li><strong>4/9/18</strong> - We've been blocked on our old URL (linearequations.cf) and have moved to a new URL (linearequations.qq). We've also finally tested and implemented a working fullscreen option for Zombs Royale as a test; we hope after 2 days of testing to implement it site-wide. We have also removed the dead FAQs link.</li>
      <li><strong>4/10/18</strong> - Foes might not work: it seems they've put inconsistent restrictions that, when working, make it impossible to "unblock." We've also removed the fullscreen options on games that have it built in, as well as have added it to LittleBigSnake and Foes.</li>
      <li><strong>4/19/18</strong> - Updated Discord <a href="https://discord.gg/RV875qX">link</a>, we were having invite issues, but they're now fixed.</li>
      <li><strong>4/24/18</strong> - Removed Zombs Royale/LittleBigSnake (officially blocked; what's the point in having inaccessible games?)...</li>
      <li><strong>4/26/18</strong> - Added back LittleBigSnake (new unblocking method) and moved to a new URL (linearequations.ml) from our old URL (linearequations.ga).</li>
      <li><strong>4/27/18</strong> - Added back Zombs Royale and Shell Shockers (new unblocking method; may be slow but works!).</li>
      <li><strong>5/3/18</strong> - Added an all new Twitch Unblocker to unblock Twitch streams at school! Added list of best streamers with links to click on. Added fullscreen option to Site Unblocker.</li>
      <li><strong>5/7/18</strong> - Wow! The school just blocked LittleBigSnake, Town of Salem and Advanced Pixel Apocalypse 3. We're currently working on new methods to get past the censorship! We may also switch to .tk soon. Fixed default page for Site Unblocker.</li>
      <li><strong>5/10/18</strong> - Switched domains (from linearequations.ml to linearequations.tk). Made Games dropdown menu scrolling to allow for more games (stopping people from scrolling the entire page). Added more games back to the site. Added two new games: War Soldiers and Masked Forces. Updated <a href="https://discord.gg/RV875qX">Discord</a> invite link.</li>
      <li><strong>5/12/18</strong> - Switched domains (from linearequations.tk to linearalgebra.tk). Added a multitude of games; scroll down while hovering on the Games dropdown menu to see. Added FAQs page link (this time, it's legitimate).</li>
      <li><strong>5/14/18</strong> - Switched domains again. Added Basketball Legends.</li>
      <li><strong>5/17/18</strong> - Added 2KMTCentral.</li>
      <li><strong>5/18/18</strong> - Added Site Unblocker V2; this site unblocker functions differently in a few ways then the Site Unblocker. One way is that it only takes HTTP/HTTPS URLs, another way is that it routes all sites through a proxy. Also added responsive games (make your window smaller and watch the games compress to the window size!). Also added Facepunch.</li>
      <li><strong>5/19/18</strong> - Made Unblockers dropdown menu to organize navigation bar. Switched domains (from linearalgebra.ml to linearalgebra.cf).</li>
      <li><strong>6/15/18</strong> - Switched the site into summer mode! No hidden homepage or any other garbage, also switched domains (from linearalgebra.cf to www.gbmsgames.cf). Simplified Twitch Unblocker input.</li>
      <li><strong>6/16/18</strong> - Added borders to game frames (easier to distinguish the edges of the games and the website), also beta-testing a "fixed" navbar for the website (sticks to top of page while scrolling).</li>
      <li><strong>6/26/18</strong> - Removed proxy links and switched to <a href="<?php echo (substr($_SERVER["HTTP_HOST"], 0, strlen("www.")) === "www.") ? "https://" . $_SERVER["HTTP_HOST"] : "http://" . $_SERVER["HTTP_HOST"]; ?>/">HTTPS</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>6/27/18</strong> - Removed redundant Site Unblocker V2, and simply updated the Site Unblocker.</li>
